# Release notes

Write the next release's notes in `next.md`. There is no version in the name, so
nothing has to be decided in advance — the release workflow works out the version
from the `patch`/`minor`/`major` choice, renames `next.md` to `<version>.md`, and
drops a fresh copy of `TEMPLATE.md` in its place.

The workflow refuses to release while `next.md` is still the unedited template.

The file becomes the GitHub release body verbatim, and
`Scripts/release/render-notes.sh` converts it to the HTML fragment embedded in
the appcast's `<description>` CDATA and shown in Sparkle's update dialog. Same
source, both destinations — so write for users rather than summarizing commits:

```markdown
- New: Something people asked for
- Fixed: Something that was broken

**Note**: Anything worth calling out before updating.
```

Lists, paragraphs, bold, italic, links, tables, task lists, and strikethrough all
work. Two things are rejected, because each would reach one destination and not
the other:

- **HTML tags**. GitHub renders them, but the appcast conversion drops them, so
  the release page and Sparkle's dialog would disagree.
- **Code blocks**, including a line indented four spaces. The appcast entry is
  indented to match its surroundings, and that indentation would show inside a
  `<pre>`.

Footnotes are the one GitHub construct left unsupported, and render as literal
`[^1]` markers.

Rendering uses [cmark-gfm](https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm), GitHub's own
Markdown implementation, so Sparkle shows what the release page shows. To run the
script tests locally: `brew install cmark-gfm`.

The `<version>.md` files are the archive of what shipped in each release.
